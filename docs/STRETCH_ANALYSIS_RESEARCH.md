# Stretch Analysis - Technical Research & Solutions

## 🎯 What is Stretch Analysis?

**Core Concept:** Measure how long each word is pronounced relative to its syllable count

**Formula:** `Stretch Score = Word Duration (seconds) ÷ Syllable Count`

**Example:**
- Word: "hello"
- Syllables: 2 (hel-lo)
- Duration: 0.8 seconds
- Stretch Score: 0.8 ÷ 2 = **0.4 s/syllable** → **Stretched**

**Normal speech:** ~0.2-0.3 seconds per syllable
**Stretched speech:** >0.3 seconds per syllable

---

## 🔬 Required Components

To implement stretch analysis, we need **2 main components**:

### 1. **Word-Level Timestamps**
Get exact timing (start/end) for each word in audio

### 2. **Syllable Counting**
Determine how many syllables each word has

---

## 📚 Available Libraries & Solutions

### **Component 1: Word-Level Timestamps**

Your codebase currently supports **3 methods**:

#### ✅ **Method 1: OpenAI Whisper** (Currently Primary)
```python
from src.transcribers.openai_transcriber import transcribe_with_openai_timestamps
```

**What it does:**
- Uses OpenAI's Whisper API to transcribe audio
- Returns word-level timestamps with high accuracy
- Model: `whisper-1` (NOT gpt-4o-transcribe, which lacks word timestamps)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Extremely accurate transcription
- ✅ Handles multiple languages
- ✅ Works well with noisy audio
- ✅ Good with various accents
- ✅ Easy API integration
- ✅ Professional-grade quality

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires OpenAI API key
- ❌ Costs money per usage
- ❌ Requires internet connection
- ❌ Subject to API rate limits
- ❌ External dependency

**Cost:** ~$0.006 per minute of audio

**Best for:** Production use, multilingual audio, high accuracy requirements

**Current Status:** ✅ **Working in your codebase**

---

#### ✅ **Method 2: ForceAlign** (Alternative)
```python
from src.transcribers.forcealign_transcriber import transcribe_with_forcealign_timestamps
```

**What it does:**
- Uses Wav2Vec2 model for speech recognition
- Performs forced alignment to get precise word timing
- Can work with provided transcript OR auto-generate

**Pros:**
- ✅ Completely free and offline
- ✅ No API key needed
- ✅ Fast processing
- ✅ Very precise word alignment
- ✅ Great for speech research
- ✅ Privacy-friendly (local processing)

**Cons:**
- ❌ English only
- ❌ Requires clear audio quality
- ❌ May struggle with strong accents
- ❌ Lower transcription accuracy than Whisper
- ❌ Needs PyTorch installation (~2GB)

**Installation:** `pip install forcealign`

**Best for:** English-only audio, offline processing, research projects, budget constraints

**Current Status:** ✅ **Implemented in your codebase**

---

#### ✅ **Method 3: Deepgram + ForceAlign Hybrid** (Best of Both)
```python
from src.transcribers.deepgram_transcriber import hybrid_deepgram_forcealign_timestamps
```

**What it does:**
1. **Step 1:** Uses Deepgram API for high-quality transcription
2. **Step 2:** Uses ForceAlign to align that transcript with audio for precise timing

**Workflow:**
```
Audio → Deepgram (get accurate transcript) → ForceAlign (align words to audio) → Word timestamps
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Best transcription accuracy (Deepgram)
- ✅ Most precise timing (ForceAlign)
- ✅ Good formatting and punctuation
- ✅ Fast API response
- ✅ Combines strengths of both tools

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires Deepgram API key (paid)
- ❌ English only for alignment
- ❌ More complex setup
- ❌ Two-step process

**Cost:** Deepgram pricing (~$0.0043/minute) + free ForceAlign

**Best for:** Maximum accuracy and precision, English audio, professional applications

**Current Status:** ✅ **Implemented in your codebase**

---

### **Component 2: Syllable Counting**

#### ✅ **NLTK + CMU Pronouncing Dictionary** (Currently Used)
```python
from nltk.corpus import cmudict
```

**What it does:**
- Uses Carnegie Mellon University's pronunciation dictionary
- Contains 130,000+ English words with phonetic pronunciations
- Counts vowel sounds to determine syllables

**Pros:**
- ✅ Extremely accurate for English words
- ✅ Handles irregular pronunciations
- ✅ Free and open source
- ✅ Well-maintained
- ✅ Includes multiple pronunciations per word
- ✅ Works offline after download

**Cons:**
- ❌ English only
- ❌ May not have very new slang/technical words
- ❌ Requires NLTK download (~10MB)

**Fallback algorithm:** Your code includes a vowel-counting algorithm for words not in dictionary

**Current Status:** ✅ **Working perfectly in your codebase**

**Accuracy:** ~98% for common English words

---

## 🔍 Additional Enhancement: Energy-Based Timing Correction

#### ✅ **Speech Boundary Detector** (Advanced Feature)
```python
from src.analyzers.speech_boundary_detector import analyze_timing_accuracy
```

**What it does:**
- Uses librosa to analyze audio energy/amplitude
- Detects actual speech start/end using RMS energy
- Corrects transcription timestamps if they include silence

**Why it matters:**
- Transcription APIs sometimes include leading/trailing silence
- Energy analysis finds **exact** moment speech starts/ends
- Improves stretch calculation accuracy

**Algorithm:**
1. Calculate RMS (root mean square) energy in 25ms frames
2. Set threshold at 20th percentile of energy
3. Find first/last frames above threshold
4. Compare with transcription timing
5. Use corrected timing if difference >100ms

**Pros:**
- ✅ Improves timing accuracy
- ✅ Removes silence padding
- ✅ Works with any transcription method
- ✅ Free (librosa-based)

**Current Status:** ✅ **Integrated in stretch_analyzer.py**

### **Suggested Improvements (Optional)**

#### 1. **Add Method Selection UI** ⭐ High Priority
Let users choose transcription method in UI:
```python
method = st.selectbox(
    "Transcription Method",
    ["OpenAI Whisper (Recommended)",
     "ForceAlign (Free/Offline)",
     "Deepgram + ForceAlign (Best Precision)"]
)
```

#### 2. **Add Caching** ⭐ Medium Priority
Cache transcription results to avoid re-processing:
```python
@st.cache_data
def get_word_timestamps(file_path, method):
    # Transcribe only once per file
```

#### 3. **Add Batch Processing Stats** ⭐ Low Priority
Show comparison across methods when batch analyzing

#### 4. **Add Visualization** ⭐ Medium Priority
Show stretch scores on waveform timeline (like pause analysis)

---

## 💡 Testing Recommendation

To validate accuracy, run comparison test:

```python
# Test file with known speech
test_audio = "sample_audio/Stretch 3.wav"

# Test all 3 methods
results = {
    "openai": analyze_stretch(test_audio, method="openai"),
    "forcealign": analyze_stretch(test_audio, method="forcealign"),
    "hybrid": analyze_stretch(test_audio, method="deepgram_forcealign")
}

# Compare results
for method, result in results.items():
    print(f"{method}: {result['summary']['avg_stretch_score']}")
```

This will show you accuracy differences between methods.
