# ‚úÖ Setup Complete - Stretch Method Testing Ready!

## üéâ What's Been Set Up

### 1. **UI Already Has Method Selection** ‚úÖ
Your Streamlit UI ([src/pages/stretch_page.py](../src/pages/stretch_page.py)) already includes:
- ‚úÖ Dropdown to select between 3 methods
- ‚úÖ Method-specific settings (API keys, models)
- ‚úÖ Smart validation (checks if APIs/libraries available)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced comparison display
- ‚úÖ Visual indicators showing which method was used

### 2. **All Imports Fixed** ‚úÖ
Updated to work with new project structure:
- ‚úÖ [src/pages/stretch_page.py](../src/pages/stretch_page.py) - Fixed imports
- ‚úÖ [src/analyzers/stretch_analyzer.py](../src/analyzers/stretch_analyzer.py) - Fixed imports

### 3. **Test Script Created** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ [tests/test_stretch_methods_comparison.py](../tests/test_stretch_methods_comparison.py)
- Automatically tests all 3 methods
- Shows side-by-side comparison
- Provides recommendations

### 4. **Documentation Created** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ [docs/STRETCH_ANALYSIS_RESEARCH.md](STRETCH_ANALYSIS_RESEARCH.md) - Complete research
- ‚úÖ [docs/TESTING_STRETCH_METHODS.md](TESTING_STRETCH_METHODS.md) - Testing guide
- ‚úÖ [docs/METRICS_OVERVIEW.md](METRICS_OVERVIEW.md) - User-facing metrics explanation

## üöÄ How to Test Now

### Option 1: Via Streamlit UI (Easiest)

```bash
# 1. Start the app
streamlit run app.py

# 2. Go to "Stretch Analysis" page

# 3. In sidebar, select method:
#    - OpenAI Whisper (default)
#    - ForceAlign
#    - Deepgram + ForceAlign (Hybrid)

# 4. Upload audio and analyze

# 5. Switch methods and re-analyze to compare
```

### Option 2: Via Test Script (Automated)

```bash
# Test all methods at once
python tests/test_stretch_methods_comparison.py

# Or with specific audio file
python tests/test_stretch_methods_comparison.py sample_audio/Stretch 3.wav
```

---

## üìã What You Need for Each Method

### **Method 1: OpenAI Whisper** (Currently Working)
```bash
# Already installed
# Just need API key in .env:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

### **Method 2: ForceAlign** (Need to Install)
```bash
pip install forcealign
# May also need PyTorch if not already installed
```

### **Method 3: Deepgram + ForceAlign Hybrid** (Need Both)
```bash
# Install libraries
pip install forcealign deepgram-sdk

# Add to .env:
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your-deepgram-key
```

---

## üéØ Quick Test Steps

1. **Test OpenAI Whisper first** (you already have this working):
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   # Go to Stretch Analysis ‚Üí Upload audio ‚Üí Analyze
   ```

2. **Install ForceAlign and test**:
   ```bash
   pip install forcealign
   # Restart Streamlit ‚Üí Change method to "ForceAlign" ‚Üí Analyze
   ```

3. **If you want hybrid, get Deepgram API key**:
   - Sign up at https://deepgram.com
   - Get API key
   - Add to .env file
   - Install: `pip install deepgram-sdk`
   - Change method to "Deepgram + ForceAlign (Hybrid)"

4. **Compare results** to see which works best for your audio!

## üìä What to Compare

When testing the 3 methods, look at:

### Accuracy
- Does the transcript match what was said?
- Are all words detected?
- Any hallucinated/missing words?

### Precision
- Do stretch scores make sense?
- Are slow words correctly identified?
- Does timing look reasonable?

### Reliability
- Does it handle your audio quality?
- Works with accents/languages you need?
- Consistent results?

### Practical Factors
- Speed (how long to analyze)
- Cost (API fees vs free)
- Offline capability
- Ease of setup

---

## üí° Expected Differences

### OpenAI Whisper
- **Best transcript accuracy**
- Costs ~$0.006/minute
- Requires internet
- Works with any language/accent

### ForceAlign
- **Completely free**
- Works offline
- English only
- Needs clear audio

### Deepgram + ForceAlign
- **Best overall precision**
- Costs ~$0.004/minute (cheaper than OpenAI!)
- Requires internet
- English only (for alignment)

---

## üêõ If You Run Into Issues

### UI Method Selection Not Showing?
- Make sure you're on the "Stretch Analysis" page
- Check sidebar for "Analysis Method" dropdown

### Import Errors?
- Restart Streamlit after installing new packages
- Check that you're running from the project root

### API Errors?
- Verify API keys in .env file
- Check .env is in project root (same folder as app.py)
- Restart Streamlit after updating .env

### ForceAlign Installation Issues?
```bash
# Try installing PyTorch first
pip install torch

# Then ForceAlign
pip install forcealign
```

---

## üìñ Next Steps

1. **Test with your sample audio** ([sample_audio/Stretch 3.wav](../sample_audio/Stretch 3.wav))

2. **Compare all 3 methods** using either:
   - Streamlit UI (switch dropdown and re-analyze)
   - Test script (automatic comparison)

3. **Choose your preferred method** based on results

4. **Set as default** in the UI (just change `index=0` to the method you prefer)

5. **Document your choice** for your team

## ‚úÖ Summary

You're **ready to test!**

Your UI already has everything built in - just select the method in the dropdown and analyze.

The **Deepgram + ForceAlign Hybrid** method is what you asked to test - it combines:
- üéØ **Deepgram** for high-quality transcription
- üîß **ForceAlign** for precise word timing alignment
- üìè **NLTK** for syllable counting

**To test it:**
1. Install: `pip install forcealign deepgram-sdk`
2. Get Deepgram API key: https://deepgram.com
3. Add to .env: `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your-key`
4. Restart Streamlit
5. Select "Deepgram + ForceAlign (Hybrid)" in UI
6. Upload audio and analyze!

Good luck! üöÄ
