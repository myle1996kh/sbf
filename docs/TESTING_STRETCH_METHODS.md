# Testing Stretch Analysis Methods

## üéØ Goal
Compare all 3 transcription methods for stretch analysis to see which works best for your needs.

---

## üìã Prerequisites

### For All Methods:
```bash
pip install nltk librosa numpy pandas
```

### Method 1: OpenAI Whisper
```bash
# Set in .env file:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

### Method 2: ForceAlign
```bash
pip install forcealign
```

### Method 3: Deepgram + ForceAlign Hybrid
```bash
pip install forcealign deepgram-sdk

# Set in .env file:
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

---

## üß™ How to Test

### Option 1: Run Automated Comparison Test

```bash
# Test with default sample audio
python tests/test_stretch_methods_comparison.py

# Test with your own audio file
python tests/test_stretch_methods_comparison.py path/to/your/audio.wav
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Run all 3 methods on the same audio
- ‚úÖ Show side-by-side comparison
- ‚úÖ Display which methods succeeded/failed
- ‚úÖ Provide recommendations

### Option 2: Test via UI (Streamlit)

1. Start the app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Navigate to: **Stretch Analysis** page

3. In sidebar, select analysis method:
   - OpenAI Whisper
   - ForceAlign
   - Deepgram + ForceAlign (Hybrid)

4. Upload audio and click **Analyze Speech Stretch**

5. Compare results by switching methods and re-analyzing

## üìä What to Look For

### Success Indicators:
- ‚úÖ Analysis completes without errors
- ‚úÖ Transcript matches audio content
- ‚úÖ Word count is reasonable
- ‚úÖ Stretch scores make sense (0.2-0.5 s/syllable)

### Quality Comparison:

**Transcription Accuracy:**
- Check if transcript matches what was actually said
- Look for missing words or hallucinations
- Verify proper word boundaries

**Timing Precision:**
- Check if stretch scores correlate with actual pronunciation
- Look at "energy_corrected" vs "transcription_based" timing
- Verify speech duration is reasonable

**Method Reliability:**
- Does it handle your audio quality?
- Does it work with your accent/language?
- Is it consistent across multiple files?

üí° RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

‚úÖ Multiple methods worked! Here's how to choose:

üîÑ OpenAI Whisper:
   - Best for: High accuracy, multiple languages, production use
   - Requires: OpenAI API key, internet connection
   - Cost: ~$0.006 per minute

üéØ ForceAlign:
   - Best for: Free/offline processing, English-only, clear audio
   - Requires: pip install forcealign
   - Cost: Free

üöÄ Deepgram + ForceAlign Hybrid:
   - Best for: Maximum accuracy + precision, English audio
   - Requires: Deepgram API key, ForceAlign installation
   - Cost: ~$0.004 per minute (Deepgram only)
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### OpenAI Whisper Issues:

**Error: "OpenAI API Key not found"**
```bash
# Add to .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key
```

**Error: "No word timestamps"**
- Make sure you're using `whisper-1` model
- `gpt-4o-transcribe` doesn't support word timestamps

### ForceAlign Issues:

**Error: "ForceAlign not available"**
```bash
pip install forcealign
# May require PyTorch
pip install torch
```

**Error: "Import error"**
- ForceAlign needs clear audio
- Try resampling audio to 16kHz WAV

### Deepgram Issues:

**Error: "Deepgram API Key not found"**
```bash
# Add to .env file
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your-deepgram-key
```

**Error: "Deepgram SDK not installed"**
```bash
pip install deepgram-sdk
```

## üí° Tips for Best Results

### Audio Quality:
- ‚úÖ Use WAV or high-quality MP3
- ‚úÖ Clear speech (minimal background noise)
- ‚úÖ Sample rate: 16kHz or higher
- ‚úÖ Mono or stereo both work

### Method Selection:
- **Production app:** OpenAI Whisper (most reliable)
- **Budget conscious:** ForceAlign (free!)
- **Maximum accuracy:** Deepgram + ForceAlign
- **Offline needed:** ForceAlign only

### Threshold Tuning:
- Start with **0.38 sec/syllable** (default)
- Lower (0.30) = more sensitive, catches slower words
- Higher (0.45) = less sensitive, only very stretched words

---

## üìà Expected Results

### Normal Speech:
- Avg stretch: 0.20-0.30 sec/syllable
- Stretched words: 10-20%

### Slow/Careful Speech:
- Avg stretch: 0.30-0.40 sec/syllable
- Stretched words: 20-40%

### Emphasized Speech:
- Avg stretch: 0.35-0.50 sec/syllable
- Stretched words: 30-50%

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

After testing, update your UI method selection based on:
1. Which methods worked for your audio
2. Your budget (free vs paid)
3. Your accuracy requirements
4. Online vs offline needs

The Streamlit UI already supports all 3 methods - just select in the dropdown!
