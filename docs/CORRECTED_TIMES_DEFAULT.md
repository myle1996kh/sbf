# ✅ Corrected Times - Now Default!

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before
- ❌ Checkbox unchecked by default
- ❌ Users had to manually enable "Show Corrected Times"
- ❌ Start/End times showed transcription offsets (starting from 0.0s)

### After ✅
- ✅ **Corrected times enabled by default**
- ✅ Start/End times show **real audio timestamps**
- ✅ Automatically applies when energy-correction is used
- ✅ Works in both Individual and Batch analysis

---

## 📊 What Are Corrected Times?

### The Problem
When audio has silence at the beginning:
```
Audio File:
[silence 2.5s] [word1] [word2] [word3]...
```

**Transcription API says:**
- word1 starts at 0.0s
- word2 starts at 0.4s

**But in reality:**
- word1 starts at 2.5s (after initial silence!)
- word2 starts at 2.9s

### The Solution: Energy-Based Correction

The **speech_boundary_detector** uses audio energy analysis to find:
- 🎯 **Real speech start time** (when voice actually begins)
- 🎯 **Real speech end time** (when voice actually stops)

Then it **adds the offset** to all word timestamps:
```
Corrected time = Transcription time + Real speech start
```

### Example
```
Transcription says:
- "hello" at 0.0s - 0.3s
- "world" at 0.4s - 0.8s

Energy detector finds:
- Real speech starts at 2.5s

Corrected times:
- "hello" at 2.5s - 2.8s  ✅
- "world" at 2.9s - 3.3s  ✅
```

## 🔍 When Does This Apply?

### Automatically Applied When:
1. ✅ Energy-based speech detection succeeds
2. ✅ Initial silence > 100ms detected
3. ✅ Timing correction recommended by analyzer

### Shows As:
- **Individual Page:** `Timing: ⚡ Energy-Corrected`
- **Info Message:** `Real speech starts at 2.5s (excludes 2.5s of initial silence)`
- **Checkbox:** Checked by default (can uncheck to see original)

### Not Applied When:
- ❌ Energy detection fails
- ❌ No significant initial silence
- ❌ Timing correction not recommended
- Shows as: `Timing: Transcription-based`

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

### For Users
**Before (Wrong Times):**
- "The word 'hello' is at 0 seconds"
- Opens audio at 0s → hears silence! ❌
- Has to guess where speech actually starts

**After (Correct Times):**
- "The word 'hello' is at 2.5 seconds"
- Opens audio at 2.5s → hears "hello"! ✅
- Can jump directly to any word

### For Analysis
**More Accurate Metrics:**
- Duration calculations correct
- Word spacing accurate
- Timeline makes sense
- Can correlate with original audio

### For Comparison
**Cross-file comparisons work:**
- All files use real timestamps
- Can overlay timelines
- Consistent reference frame

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. Audio Editing
```
Find stretched word at 15.3s
→ Open audio in editor
→ Jump to 15.3s
→ Word is actually there! ✅
```

### 2. Subtitle Sync
```
Export word timestamps
→ Use in subtitle software
→ Timings match audio ✅
→ Perfect synchronization
```

### 3. Quality Control
```
Batch analyze 10 files
→ Check stretched words
→ Note real timestamps
→ QC team can find exact moments
```

### 4. Research Data
```
Export CSV with timestamps
→ Correlate with other measures
→ Align with video/physiology
→ Accurate timeline for analysis
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Code Changes

**Individual Page ([src/pages/stretch_page.py](../src/pages/stretch_page.py)):**
```python
# Line 313
show_corrected_times = True  # Changed from False

# Line 324
st.checkbox("Show Corrected Times", value=True)  # Added value=True
```

**Batch Page ([src/pages/batch_analysis.py](../src/pages/batch_analysis.py)):**
```python
# Line 986
show_corrected_times = True  # Default to True

# Lines 1004-1008
if show_corrected_times and timing_method == "energy_corrected":
    real_start = summary.get('real_start_time', 0)
    filtered_table = filtered_table.copy()
    filtered_table['Start'] = filtered_table['Start'] + real_start
    filtered_table['End'] = filtered_table['End'] + real_start
```

### How It Works

1. **Analysis Phase:**
   - `speech_boundary_detector.py` analyzes audio energy
   - Finds real speech start/end using RMS threshold
   - Returns correction offset

2. **Stretch Analysis:**
   - Receives transcription word times (0-based)
   - Receives energy correction data
   - Stores both in result

3. **Display Phase:**
   - Checks if energy correction available
   - **Automatically applies offset** (new default)
   - Shows info message
   - Checkbox allows toggling

4. **User Control:**
   - Checkbox checked by default ✅
   - Can uncheck to see original times
   - Helps debug/compare methods

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Times Still Look Wrong?"
- Check `Timing:` indicator
- If says "Transcription-based" → Energy correction not applied
- No initial silence → No correction needed
- This is expected behavior

### "Want Original Times?"
- **Individual:** Uncheck "Show Corrected Times"
- **Batch:** Times auto-corrected (for consistency)
- Can download and manually adjust if needed

### "Different Files Show Different Offsets?"
- ✅ This is correct!
- Each file has different initial silence
- Each gets appropriate correction
- All show real audio positions
