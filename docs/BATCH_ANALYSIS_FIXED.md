## üöÄ How to Use Batch Stretch Analysis

### Step 1: Start the App
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Batch Analysis
- Click on dropdown at top
- Select: **Batch Analysis**

### Step 3: Choose Analysis Type
- Select: **Stretch Analysis**

### Step 4: Select Method
In the sidebar, choose your transcription method:

**Option 1: OpenAI Whisper** (Recommended)
- Requires: OPENAI_API_KEY in .env
- Best for: High accuracy, any audio quality
- Cost: ~$0.006/minute

**Option 2: ForceAlign** (Free)
- Requires: `pip install forcealign`
- Best for: Offline, English clear audio
- Cost: Free!

**Option 3: Deepgram + ForceAlign Hybrid** (NEW!)
- Requires:
  - DEEPGRAM_API_KEY in .env
  - `pip install forcealign deepgram-sdk`
- Best for: Maximum precision
- Cost: ~$0.004/minute

### Step 5: Configure Parameters
- Adjust **Stretch Threshold** (default: 0.38 sec/syllable)
- Lower = more sensitive (catches more words)
- Higher = less sensitive (only very stretched)

### Step 6: Upload Multiple Files
- Click "Choose audio files"
- Select multiple WAV, MP3, M4A, or FLAC files
- All files will be shown in a list

### Step 7: Start Batch Analysis
- Click **üöÄ Start Batch Analysis**
- Progress bar shows current file being processed
- Each file analyzed with selected method

### Step 8: View Results
See comprehensive results table with:
- File name
- Total words detected
- Number of stretched words
- Stretch percentage
- Average stretch score
- Status (Success/Error)

### Step 9: Download Results
- Click **üì• Download Stretch Batch Results CSV**
- Opens in Excel or Google Sheets
- Contains all metrics for all files

## üí° Tips for Best Results

### File Organization
- Name files descriptively (e.g., `patient_john_session1.wav`)
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Group related files together

### Method Selection
- **Testing:** Use all 3 methods, compare results
- **Production:** Stick with most accurate for your audio
- **Budget:** ForceAlign is free and fast
- **Accuracy:** Deepgram+ForceAlign hybrid is most precise

### Batch Size
- Process 5-10 files at a time for optimal speed
- Larger batches take longer (sequential processing)
- Monitor progress bar for status

### Quality Control
- Check "Status" column for errors
- Failed files often have audio quality issues
- Re-process failures with different method

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Import Error" or "Module Not Found"
- **Fixed!** All imports now use correct `src/` paths
- Restart Streamlit if you just updated

### "API Key Not Found"
```bash
# Add to .env file in project root:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your-deepgram-key
```

### "ForceAlign Not Available"
```bash
pip install forcealign
# May also need PyTorch
pip install torch
```

### "Deepgram SDK Not Installed"
```bash
pip install deepgram-sdk
```

### All Files Failing
- Check audio file quality
- Try different transcription method
- Verify API keys are valid
- Check file formats (WAV works best)

---

## üìà Performance

### Processing Speed (per file)
- **OpenAI Whisper:** ~30-60 seconds (API dependent)
- **ForceAlign:** ~15-30 seconds (local processing)
- **Deepgram Hybrid:** ~20-40 seconds (2-step process)

### Parallel Processing
- Volume & Velocity: ‚úÖ Parallel (3 workers)
- Pause Analysis: ‚ùå Sequential
- Stretch Analysis: ‚ùå Sequential

**Why sequential?**
- Transcription APIs have rate limits
- Prevents overwhelming API endpoints
- More reliable for large batches

---

## ‚úÖ What's Fixed

1. ‚úÖ **Import paths updated** - All `src/` imports corrected
2. ‚úÖ **Deepgram hybrid added** - Now available in batch mode
3. ‚úÖ **Method display** - Shows which method is being used
4. ‚úÖ **Better error handling** - Clearer error messages
5. ‚úÖ **Enhanced validation** - Checks API keys and libraries

---

## üéì Next Steps

1. **Test with sample files**
   - Use files from `sample_audio/` folder
   - Try all 3 methods
   - Compare results

2. **Choose your default method**
   - Based on accuracy for your audio
   - Consider cost and speed
   - Update index in selectbox if needed

3. **Create workflow**
   - Organize files in batches
   - Set consistent parameters
   - Export and track over time

4. **Scale up**
   - Process larger batches
   - Automate with scripts
   - Integrate into pipeline
